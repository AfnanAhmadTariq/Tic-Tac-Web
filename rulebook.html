            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              This rule book outlines the gameplay, setup, winning conditions, and etiquette for two variations of the classic game Tic Tac Toe: Tic Tac Toe and Super Tic Tac Toe.
              Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid, whereas Super Tic Tac Toe is played on a larger grid consisting of multiple smaller Tic Tac Toe grids.
            </p>
        
            <h2 id="basic-rules-of-tic-tac-toe">Basic Rules of Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game.</li>
              <li>The game is played on a 3x3 grid consisting of nine cells.</li>
              <li>Players take turns placing their respective symbols (traditionally 'X' and 'O') in empty cells.</li>
              <li>The objective is to form a straight line of three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
              <li>Once a line is formed, the player who achieved it wins the game.</li>
              <li>If all cells are filled without any player forming a line, the game is a draw.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2 id="additional-rules-for-super-tic-tac-toe">Additional Rules for Super Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Super Tic Tac Toe consists of a 3x3 grid, where each cell contains another 3x3 grid.</li>
              <li>Players take turns placing their symbols in any unoccupied cell within the larger grid.</li>
              <li>The cell chosen by a player determines the smaller grid in which the opponent must play next.</li>
              <li>If a player wins a smaller grid, they claim that cell in the larger grid.</li>
              <li>The objective is to win three smaller grids in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) within the larger grid.</li>
              <li>Once a player claims three cells in a row within the larger grid, they win the game.</li>
              <li>If all cells within the larger grid are filled without any player winning, the game is a draw.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2 id="game-setup">Game Setup</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>The starting player places their symbol in an empty cell.</li>
              <li>Players take turns alternately, placing their symbols in unoccupied cells.</li>
              <li>Once a symbol is placed, itcannot be moved or changed.</li>
              <li>In Super Tic Tac Toe, the opponent's move is restricted to the smaller grid indicated by the previous player's move.</li>
              <li>Players continue until a winning condition or a draw is reached.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2 id="winning-conditions">Winning Conditions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>In Tic Tac Toe, a player wins if they form a straight line of three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
              <li>In Super Tic Tac Toe, a player wins if they claim three cells in a row within the larger grid.</li>
              <li>Once a winning condition is met, the game ends immediately.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2 id="draw-condition">Draw Condition</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>In both Tic Tac Toe and Super Tic Tac Toe, if all cells are filled without any player meeting the winning condition, the game is a draw.</li>
              <li>A draw means neither player wins, and the game ends.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h2 id="etiquette-and-fair-play">Etiquette and Fair Play</h2>

            </ol>
        
            <h2 id="variations-and-optional-rules">Variations and Optional Rules</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Players may choose different symbols or designations instead of 'X' and 'O' as long as they are distinct.</li>
              <li>Variant rules may be agreed upon, such as allowing diagonal lines for winning conditions or playing with more than two players.</li>
              <li>The use of timers or time limits for turns can be implemented to maintain the pace of the game.</li>
            </ol>
